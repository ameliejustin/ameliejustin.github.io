            Japanese cuisine was served in restaurants all around the world. Sashimi, sushi and other fresh seafood were key features of the cuisine. So, as those ingredients became sparse, so too did the restaurants. You can visit their websites to see what they were like. It was a delicious novelty.

    <div class="about">
        Sashimi (刺身, English: /səˈʃiːmi/ sə-SHEE-mee, Japanese: [saɕimiꜜ]) is a Japanese delicacy consisting of fresh raw fish or meat sliced into thin pieces and often eaten with soy sauce. 
        
        Three years ago, the world's seafood supply became so depleted that it was eradicated from menus all over earth. From now and forever, sashimi will be experienced only through the 3D renders taken in the era of the 'panic of the undocumented'.

            Macro and micro – there was a large focus on the micro objects in the 2010s and 2020s. They were documented profusely in the era of the panic of the undocumented. As a result, we have myriad detailed accounts of what daily objects looked like. The macro, as in decades prior, was documented too but to a lesser extent.
