            The Auto(m)ated Teller [M]achine. A specialised co(m)puter that (m)akes it convenient to 
            (m)anage a bank account holder's funds. It allows a person to check account balances, withdraw or deposit (m)oney, and print a state(m)ent of account activities or transactions.

            With the gradual increase of contactless payment such as Apple Pay and PayPal, ATMs slowly ceased to exist. In 2045, the last ATM standing – a blue one – was removed via crane from New York City. It was covered in graffiti, as they often were.

                Macro and micro – there was a large focus on the micro objects in the 2010s and 2020s. They were documented profusely in the era of the panic of the undocumented. As a result, we have myriad detailed accounts of what daily objects looked like. The macro, as in decades prior, was documented too but to a lesser extent.
